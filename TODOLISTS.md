##### HTML SIDE (FOR VISUAL)

##### CLIENTS SIDE

[✅] - POST ROUTE - ADD TASKS TO DB
    [✅] - Create a front end experience that allows a user to create a Task. 
    [✅] - When the Task is created, it should be stored inside of a database (SQL)
[] - GET ROUTE - GET TASKS FROM DB
    [] - Whenever a Task is created the front end should refresh to show all tasks that need to be completed.
    [] - Whether or not a Task is complete should also be stored in the database.
[] - DELETE ROUTE - DELETE TASK
    [] - Deleting a Task should remove it both from the front end as well as the Database.
[] - PUT ROUTE - DELETE AND UPDATE TASKS
    [] - Each Task should have an option to 'Complete' or 'Delete'.
    [] - When a Task is complete, its visual representation should change on the front end. For example, the background of the task container could change from gray to green. The complete option should be  'checked off'. Each of these are accomplished in CSS, but will need to hook into logic to know whether or not the task is complete.
